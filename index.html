                A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Coffee is a beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plant.

        <ul>
            <li> <b>coffee bean </b> is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the
                red or purple fruit often referred to as a coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit
                is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are
                referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most
                commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a
                single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10%
                and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more
                flavour than normal coffee beans.[3] Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist
                mostly of endosperm.</li>
            <li> <b>Robusta Coffee Beans </b> The second most popular type of coffee bean is Robusta. This bean
                originated in sub-Saharan Africa and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia. It’s also
                particularly popular in Vietnam and is often mixed into coffee blends. It’s a less expensive variety,
                making it a very budget-friendly choice for roasters.
                Robusta beans are larger and more rounded than the other bean varieties. These plants typically grow
                much larger than Arabica plants, measuring between 15 and 20 feet. Robusta beans are typically
                considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and resist diseases. But recent
                research suggests that they don’t handle heat as well as was previously thought.</li>
            <li> <b>Arabica Coffee Beans </b>Arabica beans are by far the most popular type of coffee beans, making up
                about 60% of the world’s coffee. These tasty beans originated many centuries ago in the highlands of
                Ethiopia, and may even be the first coffee beans ever consumed! The name Arabica likely comes from the
                beans’ popularity in 7th-century Arabia (present-day Yemen).

            The downside of Arabica beans is that they’re harder to grow. Because of this, Arabica beans are
            pricier. All coffee beans grow in the so-called Bean Belt, an area between the Tropics of Cancer and
            Capricorn, in 50 countries around the world. But Arabica beans need extra shade, water, and high
            altitude to grow properly. These plants are more susceptible to plant diseases and must be grown at an
            altitude of at least 2,000 feet. They’re also smaller plants, measuring between 8 and 15 feet when fully
            grown.</li>
            <li> <b>Liberica Coffee Beans </b> Native to central and western Africa – specifically Liberia, hence its
                name – Coffea liberica is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor profile. This hardy
                species is frequently mixed with other varieties to add body and complexity, but rarely receives any
                credit. Unheard of in Western civilization before the late 1800s, Liberica gained a foothold with
                Southeast Asian coffee producers after a fungal disease (“coffee rust”) wiped out much of the region’s
                Arabica crops.

                Growing from a much larger plant than Arabica or Robusta, most Liberica cherries tend to be irregular in
                shape and closer to Robusta in size and general appearance. It’s also tolerant of hot, humid climates
                and does well at low altitude. Now produced mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, the bean
                makes up roughly 2% of the world’s coffee supply. Over 95% percent of the Malaysian coffee yield is
                Liberica beans. However, it’s not commonly found in North American and European markets.</li>
